    "In my free time I enjoy experimenting with AI.  Not just solving a problem but playing around with models and parameters to get a feel for what's really going on.  One of the topics I find particularly interesting is reinforcement learning (RL).  Instead of fitting a model to a dataset, RL forces us to be creative in designing an agent that experiences the data in the form of the game state and labels in the form of rewards.  Therefore, not only do we have to be careful in how we design the model, but we need to consider how we construct the game, inputs, and reward system.  However, despite the freedom inherent in reinforcement learning, there exists an underlying structure to each problem that the model is trying to learn.  Hopefully, during the course of this notebook I'll successfully illustrate both the structure behind RL as well as the methodology behind reinforcement learning as a whole."

    "## Cartpole\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to best discuss the core concepts behind RL, I've decided to use the simplest use case known as the cartpole problem.  It consists of a pole standing on top of a cart.  The player can accelerate the cart right or left, moving the pivot point in an attempt to prevent the pole from falling.  The model is fed four different inputs; the position of the cart ($x$), the velocity of the cart ($\\dot x$), the angle of the pole ($\\theta$), and the angular velocity of the pole ($\\dot \\theta$).\n",

    "\n",
    "At the beginning of the game, each of the four values are randomly initialized between $-0.05$ and $0.05$ so that each initial state is slightly different but close to zero.  The game ends when either the absolute value of the x position exceeds $2.4$, the pole angle exceeds $41.8^{\\circ}$ or $0.2$ radians, or the game lasts for $500$ frames.  The limitation on the cart is a lot more lenient than the pole, which means any agent training to balance the pole will prioritize the pole's position over the cart's.  The agent has two options; accelerate the cart left or right.\n",

    "The cartpole is an example of an equilibrium problem, where we are trying to maintain a certain position (pole being straight up).  Furthermore, this is a type of equilibrium that is known as unstable equilibrium where the slightest deviation from the target position leads to further deviation without intervention.  As the horizonal distance limit is much larger than the angle limit, we can ignore it right now in order to simplify our analysis of the environment.  The two relevant equations are \n",

Since the purpose of the cartpole to is maintain small angular displacement from standing straight up, we can safely assume angles will be \"small\" enough.  Therefore, it seems to me that we can solve an equation balancing pole with a linear model as both $\\theta$ and $\\dot \\theta$ rely on the other in a linear relationship.  Remember that we are briefly ignoring the $x$ constraint.  To further describe the equilibrium system in this way, we can plot out a few graphs.\n",

    "Figure A demonstrates the instability of the potential energy.  This is a good initial assessment as every system tends to move towards lowest potential energy.  Figure B is known as a phase space diagram, where we graph the rate of change in terms of both position and velocity.  As we can see, the further the angle is from zero, the greater the acceleration (rate of change of velocity).  The greater the angular velocity, the greater the rate of change of angle (obviously, but what matters it that the rate of change is pointed away from the center or equilibrium point).  While describing the same phenomena, the phase space diagram does a much better job because we can see that the velocity is much more dangerous to equilibrium than the angle (this is because the game ends at smaller angles so gravity does not get a chance to really affect the pole).  Another thing to note is that the velocity values will seem higher than possible.  This is because the game runs at $50$ fps so that any model has the ability to update the speed every $0.02$ seconds.  Therefore it is possible to achieve angular velocities greater than the $\\theta$ constraint per second as there are 50 frames to adjust $\\omega$ before that distance is travelled.\n",

Essentially, the Euler-Lagrange equation solves for the shortest path between two points in a given space, and feeding in the energy of a system into the equation allows us to find the shortest path through the energy space.

For now, I'll keep with the assumption that solving eq (4) properly will solve the practical dynamics of the cartpole (and any similar RL environments).

However, the phase space diagram exposes the fact that the angle is slowly increasing as well.  This is because the greater the angle, the more the pole tends to increase speed in that direction.  Merely controlling the speed will then cause the pole to slip as the average speed will be slightly in favor of increasing towards the pole's fall.\n",

    "## Reinforcement Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, before we can begin building models, I'd like to define a few terms and explain the concept behind reinforcement learning.  Reinforcement learning (RL) has three main components; environment, agent, and reward system.  The environment is everything that makes up the game or task that we are trying to solve.  The agent is a model that attempts to interact with the environment in order to maximize the reward.  The interplay between agent and environment forms the core of RL and looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "1: <b>Initial Game State</b>:  The environment is in state $s_{i}$.  All the important information about the environment should be encoded into this game state, which the agent's model treats as an input.  This is a very important part of designing an environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "2: <b>Agent's Action</b>:  The agent converts the state into a policy vector with the length of $n$ (number of possible actions): \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\pi(s_{i}) = \\pi_{i}$$  \n",
    "The policy predicts the expected reward for each action given the state.  The action chosen is \n",
    "\n",
    "$$a_{i} = \\arg\\max(\\pi(s_{i}))$$\n",
    "\n",
    "or the action with the highest associated $q$ value.  Note that the $i^{th}$ value of $\\pi$ can be written as \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\pi_{i} = Q(s_{i},a_{i})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "3: <b>Reward</b>:  The environment receives the reward from the agent and then determines the next state, $s_{i+1}$.  This does NOT have to be deterministic.  The environment also uses the reward system to give a reward to the agent.\n",
    "\n",
    "4: <b>Update</b>:  The agent then updates the predicted $q$ value for that given state-action pair.  This is done using the bellman equation: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ Q(s_{i},a_{i}) = r_i + \\gamma\\max(\\pi(s_{i+1}))$$  \n",

   ]
  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "The bellman equation is very powerful, as it allows the agent to consider future values as well.  Even though it only directly considers states $i$ and $i+1$, the value of $\\pi(s_{i+1})$ will recursively consider the next state and the one after that and so on.  In order to prevent the $q$ values from blowing up, a discount factor, $\\gamma$, is used.  Gamma is a number between $0$ and $1$, and the closer to $1$ the further into the future the agent will look.  This will also have the effect of smoothing over $q$ values and will dampen the impact of each individual action.\n",
    "\n",
    "Agents begin training with little agency.  Tracked by the value $\\epsilon$, agents begin by picking moves randomly.  This helps the model get a feel for the true $q$ values and prevents the agent from getting trapped into picking the same action repeatedly.  It is also better to initialize models so that they overestimate the $q$ values.  This means that as actions are picked, their $q$ values are slowly dropped down to realistic values.  Even if an agent gains agency too quickly, they'll be picking the least chosen actions and dropping their expected $q$ values further down.  Another way around this is to allow the model to be initialized around $0$, and then set the rewards to small values and the punishment to a large negative number.  "

    "## Markov Agent\n",
    "\n",
    "A markov agent is the simplest RL model possible.  It treats each state as independent of the other states and determines the best moves using a Q-value function $Q(s_i,a_i)$.  In fact, this model relies on something known as the markov assumption, which assumes that the previous states have no impact on the optimal move for a given state.  The agent still cares about the success of future states when calculating the predicted $q$, it just does not need to know about the states that came before.  This applies to the cartpole because we have the speed and angular velocity of the cart and pole respectively.  However, if the agent took a screenshot of the frame as an input, this condition would not be met.  The agent would not know the speed of the cart or pole, which is very important in determining the optimal action.\n",
    "\n",
    "We use the bellman equation to update the $q$ values for each state-action pair.  I've cheated a little bit where I calculate the true reward from the next state rather than the predicted max reward as this will be a lot more stable during training.  Since we discretize the states, there is no underlying model predicting the reward..  Instead, each time we visit a state, the agent checks to see if it has been in that position before.  If not, the $q$ values are estimated with a reward of $100$ with $5$ times visiting the state.  As stated above, the $q$ values are overestimated and I've even added an extra weight of $5$ previous visits in order to slow down the updates to the estimates.  I've included my code for the markov agent below."

Just looking at the mean scores tells me nothing about what's happening, so let me show a different graph.  Each session has only three conditions where the game ends: the pole falls over, the cart leaves the frame, or the time runs out.

The first is that states that start off stable tend to remain stable so the agent learns how to keep the pole up (the max distance is really low).  The other is that when the pole is close to its limit, the optimal option is much more obvious (counteract the pole falling).  This leads to a high max distance but a clear path gets formed in the graph.  Eventually, the agent gets better at balancing the pole and an average velocity seems to form.  Most of the games end with $500$ points, but the agent never manages to get all of the games to max points.  While I could have continued to train longer, I had already trained for two days and felt that the marginal improvements would not be worth it.  Finally, this agent never reaches the $x$ limit.  This is because balancing the pole means that the cart will not move much, plus as the cart moves further out, it reaches states less visited.

The bigger the discount factor the longer we can stretch out the effect of losing.  This means that frames earlier on in the sequence will be able to adjust to learn from the single failure.

    "Training the model differs slightly from the markov agent as it does not update its values continuously.  Instead, the linear model plays for $100$ sessions, storing moves and results into memory, before sampling from that memory and training on that.  Instead of storing each unique combination of states as their own entity, the linear model assumes that there is a linear relationship between the four values.  This model also takes into account all four inputs, rather than just $\\theta$ and $\\omega$.  Finally, due an initial bug in the code, I stumbled upon something very interesting.  Normally, an agent slowly gains agency as epsilon decreases, allowing it to take control of what moves to make.  However, I accidentally trained a linear model on memory gathered from a heuristic playing completely randomly.  I've put the best performed results from both methods below.  For the model with agency, I've also included the percent chance that the agent chooses the move.  The epoch where the agent performed best had a value of $50\\%$.\n",

    "The first model, learns much faster than the markov agent up until a certain point.  The model, predictively, first learns how to balance the pole and focuses most of its efforts on the angular velocity.  However, the model gets to a point where it is not able to balance the pole perfectly but is still good enough to last until the cart reaches the $x$ limit.  This is a massive issue as the solution to this is unintuitive.  The model needs to accelerate towards the edge so that the pole points in the other direction.  This will allow the cart to be safely guided back towards the center.  The agent is not capable of understanding that if it ignored the edge and continued to focus on balancing the pole, it would eventually never reach the edge.  Due to the linear assumptions built into the model, any adjustment at the edge of the frame has a direct impact on how the model performs at the center.  This causes the bizarre and cyclical behaviour that we see in the performance progression of the model with agency.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second model surprised me even more.  It is possible to train a linear model by watching a random heuristic fail at the cartpole and to then have this model perform perfectly.  Because of the simplicity of the game, randomness is good enough to build a stochastic model of good and bad moves.  The markov assumption holds, so each frame is independent of the others.  Therefore, the better move is one that puts the pole into a state further from falling down.  The randomness of the model means that the agent's memory is essentially a probabilistic function that has experimentally mapped out proximity to falling over.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This tells me that there are two solutions to the cartpole.  The first is obvious; the model can learn how to balance the pole while adjusting the cart speed so that it remains within frame.  The second method involves balancing the pole perfectly so that the edges of the frames don't matter.  The second is a global maximum strategy unfortunately gated by the $x$ condition.  Any real model that starts from scratch won't be able to balance the pole perfectly as it will need to learn how to manage the cart's position long before it will get close to doing so.  However, we can train a linear model to perform the second method as long as we train it on a statistical distribution, either generated by a random model or markov agent."

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite its reputation for being unstructured and unruly, reinforcement learning is the process of training an agent to adapt to the underlying structure of its environment.  The physics is often too complicated to solve mathematically, but agents can get a feel for the rules through raw experience and exploration.  Markov agents are capable of doing this, but they are incredibly inefficient and exhaust memory.  For reference, here's a plot comparing the training time of the markov agent versus the neural network.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Original Image](https://github.com/alexikerd/Cartpole/blob/main/graphics/markovvsnetwork.png?raw=true)\n",
    "\n",
    "The markov agent never even managed to get a perfect session and had slowed its training down significantly.  In contrast, the network cycled through all four regions and ended on a perfect model before the markov agent managed to average $50$ points.  The purpose of an agent is to be able to map a model to a decision boundary that dictates the correct action.  This model provides generalizations that apply to previously unseen states that the markov agent cannot.  Clearly, the training progress of an agent is not obvious at first, given what I've seen.  This is especially true if there is a big time gap between gameover scenarios ($x$ and $\\theta$ limits) where the timeframe is not long enough.  Overall, its important to have a model that is complex enough to be able to successfully approximate the \"true\" decision boundary."

    "I'm done with this project.  However, I'd like to list out a few things that I think would have been interesting to dive deeper into.  Honestly, if anyone wants to do any of these, let me know and I'll put a link to the github here.  Otherwise, thanks for reading this all the way through.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. <b>Time Limit</b>:  It's clear to me that the time limit is a much bigger factor than I'd considered.  Most of people's projects involving cartpole use a much older and shorter frame limit of $200$.  My model was close to solving the game using the \"just balance better\" method with $500$ frames to last. I'm very confident that most cartpole models are only using this method rather than solving the cartpole in the method we would typically describe as knowing how to play.  I'd say increasing the frame limit to $1\\,000$ would have drastically different results for the neural network and the other, simpler models would fail. \n",
    "2. <b>$x$ Limit</b>:  A large issue with the model training was that the $x$ limit was much bigger than the $\\theta$.  What would happen if the agent had to consider the $x$ value while balancing the pole in the initial stages of training?  Would it learn how to truly play the game without ever having a region C?\n",
    "3. <b>Initial States</b>:  A large part of overfitting with RL models has to do with the agent's ability to replicate scenarios from previous runs.  The small perturbances to the initial states allows for some variety, but I'd like to see that doubled.  It would force the model to be able to handle slightly more extreme cases rather than being able to balance the pole as it stands straight up from the beginning.\n",
    "4. <b>CNN</b>:  I avoided using a convolutional neural network as I just wanted to explore basic reinforcement learning and felt that a fully connected network would be enough.  I was correct, but now I'm curious as to what kind of improvement a CNN would have and if it would be able to handle region C much more effectively.\n",
    "5. <b>RL Algorithms</b>:  I was almost much more interested in the basics of reinforcement learning.  However, there are much more complex methods of training an agent than Q learning.  For example, I could have tried dueling DQNs, noisy DQNs, etc and then compared the training.  This would be interesting to see how these methods progress in training on the cartpole problem."
